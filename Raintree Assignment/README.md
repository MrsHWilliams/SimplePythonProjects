The “logs” contains some Quality of Service log files, we want you to build a report after reading all these log files.
There are three different reports to show columns. You can complete any one of below mentioned report and reply back with the source code
1) Computer Name, No. of client Disconnects for that computer name in that date range in descending order
2) Computer Name, number of Drop Count limit exceeded for that computer in that date range in descending order.
3) Computer Name, number of Average Count limit exceeded for that computer in that date range in descending order.
You can do this programming assignment in C, Python or Java or language of your choice. Minimize use of any library functions. Ask user for date range input to generate report for that date range. You need to read all files and give results for that date range.
Report will look like :

    `Date : 01-01-2012 to 31-01-2012
    
    Computer Name Number of Disconnects
    Person A Laptop 34
    Person B Laptop 23
    Person C Laptop 12
    ..
